Based on the averaged runtime comparison over 5 trials:
- The Monotone Chain algorithm is generally faster than Graham's Scan.
- Graham's Scan involves sorting and additional computations, making it slower.
- Monotone Chain runs in O(n log n), similar to Grahamâ€™s Scan, but with fewer operations.
- For large n, the difference in execution time becomes more significant.

Overall, Monotone Chain is preferable for computing the convex hull efficiently.
